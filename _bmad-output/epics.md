# Detailed Epic Stories

## Epic 1: User Authentication & Sessions

**Goal:** Users can register, login, manage sessions, and reset passwords. Token structure supports future organization context.

### Story 1.1: User Registration with Email Verification

As a **new user**,
I want to **create an account with my email address**,
So that **I can access the Property Management System**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user is on the registration page
**When** they enter a valid email, password (min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number), and name
**Then** the system creates a pending user record
**And** sends a verification email with a unique token (valid 24 hours)
**And** displays "Check your email to verify your account"

**Given** a user clicks the verification link in the email
**When** the token is valid and not expired
**Then** the user account is activated
**And** the user is redirected to login page with success message

**Given** a user tries to register with an existing email
**When** they submit the registration form
**Then** the system displays "An account with this email already exists"
**And** does not reveal whether the account is verified or not

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `users` table with columns: id, email, password_hash, name, email_verified_at, created_at
- Use Argon2id for password hashing (NFR11)
- Email templates in SK, CS, DE, EN based on browser locale

---

### Story 1.2: Email/Password Login

As a **registered user**,
I want to **log in with my email and password**,
So that **I can access my account securely**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a verified user enters correct email and password
**When** they submit the login form
**Then** the system issues a JWT access token (15-minute expiry)
**And** issues a refresh token (7-day expiry, stored in HttpOnly cookie)
**And** redirects to the dashboard

**Given** a user enters incorrect credentials
**When** they submit the login form
**Then** the system displays "Invalid email or password"
**And** increments failed login counter
**And** after 5 failures, enforces a 15-minute lockout

**Given** an unverified user tries to log in
**When** they submit correct credentials
**Then** the system displays "Please verify your email first"
**And** offers to resend verification email

**Technical Notes:**
- JWT includes: user_id, email, iat, exp
- JWT extension point: `org_id` and `roles` claims (nullable for now)
- Rate limit: 10 login attempts per minute per IP (NFR16)

---

### Story 1.3: JWT Token Refresh

As an **authenticated user**,
I want to **stay logged in without re-entering credentials**,
So that **my session persists seamlessly**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user has a valid refresh token
**When** their access token expires
**Then** the client automatically requests a new access token
**And** receives a new access token without user interaction

**Given** a user's refresh token is expired or invalid
**When** the client attempts to refresh
**Then** the system returns 401 Unauthorized
**And** the client redirects to login page

**Given** a refresh token is used
**When** a new access token is issued
**Then** the refresh token is rotated (old one invalidated)
**And** the new refresh token is set in HttpOnly cookie

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `refresh_tokens` table: id, user_id, token_hash, expires_at, revoked_at
- Token rotation prevents replay attacks

---

### Story 1.4: Password Reset Flow

As a **user who forgot my password**,
I want to **reset my password via email**,
So that **I can regain access to my account**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user requests a password reset with a registered email
**When** they submit the request
**Then** the system sends a reset email with a unique token (valid 1 hour)
**And** displays "If an account exists, you'll receive reset instructions"

**Given** a user clicks a valid reset link
**When** they enter a new password meeting requirements
**Then** the password is updated
**And** all existing sessions are invalidated
**And** the user is redirected to login with success message

**Given** a user tries to use an expired or invalid reset token
**When** they submit the reset form
**Then** the system displays "This reset link has expired"
**And** offers to request a new reset email

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `password_reset_tokens` table: id, user_id, token_hash, expires_at, used_at
- Invalidate all refresh_tokens for user on password change

---

### Story 1.5: Active Session Management

As a **security-conscious user**,
I want to **view and revoke my active sessions**,
So that **I can protect my account from unauthorized access**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user navigates to account security settings
**When** they view active sessions
**Then** they see a list of sessions with: device type, browser, IP, location (approximate), last active, current session indicator

**Given** a user clicks "Revoke" on a session
**When** the action is confirmed
**Then** that session's refresh token is invalidated
**And** any active requests from that session receive 401

**Given** a user clicks "Revoke all other sessions"
**When** the action is confirmed
**Then** all sessions except current are invalidated
**And** the user sees confirmation message

**Technical Notes:**
- Extend `refresh_tokens` with: user_agent, ip_address, created_at
- Use IP geolocation service for approximate location
- Multi-org support: sessions span organizations (user belongs to multiple)

---

### Story 1.6: User Lifecycle Management (Admin)

As a **platform operator**,
I want to **invite, suspend, and delete users**,
So that **I can manage user access to the platform**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an admin enters an email to invite a new user
**When** they submit the invitation
**Then** the system sends an invitation email with setup link
**And** creates a pending user record with `invited_at` timestamp

**Given** an admin suspends a user account
**When** the suspension is applied
**Then** all user sessions are immediately invalidated
**And** the user cannot log in
**And** the user sees "Account suspended. Contact support." on login attempt

**Given** an admin deletes a user account
**When** the deletion is confirmed (requires typing user email)
**Then** the user record is soft-deleted (retained per GDPR)
**And** all sessions are invalidated
**And** the email cannot be reused for 30 days

**Technical Notes:**
- Add to `users`: status (active, suspended, deleted), invited_at, suspended_at, deleted_at
- Soft delete with data retention per NFR25

---

### Story 1.7: Localized Email Templates

As a **user who prefers their native language**,
I want to **receive authentication emails in my language**,
So that **I can understand important account communications**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user registers with browser locale set to Slovak
**When** the verification email is sent
**Then** the email is rendered in Slovak language
**And** uses Slovak date/time formatting

**Given** a user's browser locale is Czech, German, or English
**When** any authentication email is sent
**Then** the email is rendered in the detected language

**Given** a user's locale is not supported (e.g., French)
**When** an email is sent
**Then** the email defaults to English

**Technical Notes:**
- Create email templates: verification, password_reset, invitation, session_alert
- Each template in: sk, cs, de, en
- Store user's preferred_locale in users table (nullable, falls back to browser)

---

## Epic 2A: Organizations & Tenant Isolation

**Goal:** Organizations can onboard with complete data isolation. RLS enforcement validated via penetration test framework.

### Story 2A.1: Organization Creation

As a **platform administrator**,
I want to **create a new organization**,
So that **a group of users can manage their properties in isolation**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an admin submits organization creation form
**When** they provide name, slug (unique), and contact email
**Then** the system creates the organization record
**And** creates the organization owner user (or links existing user)
**And** the new org is completely isolated from other orgs

**Given** an organization slug is already taken
**When** the admin tries to create the org
**Then** the system displays "This URL slug is already in use"

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `organizations` table: id, name, slug, contact_email, created_at, status
- All tenant-scoped tables will have `organization_id` foreign key
- Enable PostgreSQL RLS on all tenant tables

---

### Story 2A.2: Row-Level Security Enforcement

As a **security architect**,
I want to **enforce tenant isolation at the database level**,
So that **data leakage between organizations is impossible**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** RLS policies are applied to all tenant-scoped tables
**When** any query is executed without valid tenant context
**Then** the query returns zero rows (not an error)

**Given** a user with organization A context
**When** they query any tenant-scoped table
**Then** they only see rows where organization_id matches their context

**Given** a super admin context
**When** they query tenant-scoped tables
**Then** they can see all rows (bypasses RLS for admin functions)

**Technical Notes:**
- Create RLS policies using `current_setting('app.current_org_id')`
- Set tenant context in Axum middleware from JWT org_id claim
- Create `set_tenant_context(org_id)` function

---

### Story 2A.3: RLS Penetration Test Framework

As a **security team member**,
I want to **automated tests that verify tenant isolation**,
So that **we catch RLS misconfigurations before production**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the test suite runs with two test organizations
**When** Organization A's context is set
**Then** queries to all tenant tables return only Org A data

**Given** the test creates a record in Organization A
**When** Organization B's context is set and queries the table
**Then** the record is not visible

**Given** a new table is added without RLS policy
**When** the test suite runs
**Then** it fails with "Table X missing RLS policy"

**Technical Notes:**
- Integration tests using sqlx test fixtures
- Test helper: `with_tenant_context(org_id, async_fn)`
- CI gate: all new tables must have RLS test coverage

---

### Story 2A.4: Organization Settings & Branding

As an **organization administrator**,
I want to **configure my organization's settings and branding**,
So that **the platform reflects our identity**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an org admin navigates to organization settings
**When** they update name, logo, primary color
**Then** the settings are saved
**And** the branding is applied to the organization's interface

**Given** an org admin uploads a logo
**When** the file is a valid image (PNG, JPG, max 2MB)
**Then** the logo is stored in S3 and URL saved
**And** the logo appears in the org's header

**Technical Notes:**
- Add to `organizations`: logo_url, primary_color, settings (JSONB)
- S3 upload with presigned URLs
- Settings JSONB for future extensibility

---

### Story 2A.5: Organization Member Management

As an **organization administrator**,
I want to **add and remove members from my organization**,
So that **the right people have access**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an org admin invites a user by email
**When** the user doesn't exist
**Then** an invitation email is sent with org context
**And** a pending membership record is created

**Given** an org admin invites an existing platform user
**When** the invitation is sent
**Then** the user receives a "Join Organization" email
**And** upon acceptance, they're added to the org

**Given** an org admin removes a member
**When** the removal is confirmed
**Then** the membership is revoked
**And** the user's sessions for that org are invalidated

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `organization_members` table: id, organization_id, user_id, role, joined_at
- Users can belong to multiple organizations

---

### Story 2A.6: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

As an **organization administrator**,
I want to **assign roles with specific permissions**,
So that **users only access what they're authorized for**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an org admin assigns "Manager" role to a user
**When** that user logs in
**Then** their JWT includes the role in the org context
**And** they can perform manager-level actions

**Given** a user with "Owner" role tries to access manager settings
**When** the permission check is performed
**Then** the action is denied with 403 Forbidden

**Given** an org defines custom permissions for a role
**When** a user with that role attempts an action
**Then** the permission is checked against the custom configuration

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `roles` table: id, organization_id, name, permissions (JSONB)
- Default roles: Owner, Manager, Technical Manager, Tenant, Resident
- Permission format: `resource:action` (e.g., `faults:create`, `votes:manage`)

---

### Story 2A.7: Organization Data Export

As an **organization administrator**,
I want to **export all my organization's data**,
So that **I can migrate to another system or have a backup**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an org admin requests a full data export
**When** the export is initiated
**Then** a background job collects all org data
**And** generates a ZIP file with JSON/CSV files per table
**And** sends a download link via email when complete

**Given** the export is ready
**When** the admin clicks the download link (valid 7 days)
**Then** the ZIP file downloads
**And** contains: users, buildings, units, faults, votes, documents, etc.

**Technical Notes:**
- Async job using tokio background tasks
- Export to S3 presigned URL
- Respects GDPR: user data included only with consent

---

## Epic 2B: Notification Infrastructure & Offline Foundation

**Goal:** Push, email, and in-app notifications work reliably. Event bus established. Offline sync patterns defined.

### Story 2B.1: Event Bus Foundation

As a **system architect**,
I want to **establish an event-driven architecture**,
So that **services can communicate asynchronously**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an event is published (e.g., `fault.created`)
**When** subscribers are registered for that event
**Then** all subscribers receive the event payload

**Given** multiple api-server instances are running
**When** an event is published on one instance
**Then** all instances receive the event (via Redis pub/sub)

**Given** an event fails to process
**When** the subscriber throws an error
**Then** the event is retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff

**Technical Notes:**
- Redis pub/sub for cross-instance messaging
- Event schema: `{ event_type, payload, org_id, user_id, timestamp }`
- Create `EventBus` trait with `publish()` and `subscribe()` methods

---

### Story 2B.2: Push Notification Service (FCM/APNs)

As a **mobile user**,
I want to **receive push notifications on my device**,
So that **I'm alerted to important events in real-time**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user has registered their device token
**When** an event relevant to them occurs
**Then** a push notification is sent to their device within 5 seconds (NFR7)

**Given** a user has multiple devices registered
**When** a notification is sent
**Then** all devices receive the notification
**And** tapping the notification deep-links to the relevant screen

**Given** a device token is invalid (uninstalled app)
**When** a push fails
**Then** the device token is marked as invalid
**And** removed from future notifications

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `device_tokens` table: id, user_id, token, platform (ios/android), created_at
- FCM for Android, APNs for iOS
- Batch notifications for efficiency

---

### Story 2B.3: Email Notification Service

As an **offline user**,
I want to **receive important notifications via email**,
So that **I don't miss critical updates**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user has email notifications enabled
**When** they haven't been active for 24 hours and have pending notifications
**Then** an email digest is sent with summary of notifications

**Given** a high-priority event occurs (e.g., vote deadline)
**When** the event is triggered
**Then** an immediate email is sent regardless of digest settings

**Given** an email fails to send
**When** the delivery fails
**Then** the system retries up to 3 times
**And** logs the failure for monitoring

**Technical Notes:**
- Integration with email service (SendGrid/SES)
- Email templates: immediate alerts, daily digest
- Bounce handling and unsubscribe links

---

### Story 2B.4: In-App Notification Center

As an **active user**,
I want to **see my notifications in the app**,
So that **I can review and act on them**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user logs into the app
**When** they view the notification center
**Then** they see a chronological list of notifications
**And** unread notifications are highlighted
**And** each notification links to its context

**Given** a user marks a notification as read
**When** the action is performed
**Then** the notification is no longer highlighted
**And** the unread count decrements

**Given** new notifications arrive while the user is active
**When** WebSocket connection is open
**Then** notifications appear in real-time without refresh

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `notifications` table: id, user_id, type, title, body, data (JSONB), read_at
- WebSocket channel per user for real-time updates
- Pagination for notification history

---

### Story 2B.5: Privacy-Aware Notification Design

As a **privacy-conscious user**,
I want to **notifications to respect my privacy settings**,
So that **sensitive information isn't exposed**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user has privacy mode enabled
**When** a push notification is sent
**Then** the notification shows generic text ("New update available")
**And** doesn't expose content in lock screen

**Given** a user's neighbor has hidden their profile
**When** a notification involves that neighbor
**Then** the name is anonymized ("A neighbor reported...")

**Given** notification content contains PII
**When** the notification is rendered
**Then** PII is only shown within the authenticated app context

**Technical Notes:**
- Notification payload: `{ preview: "generic", full: "detailed" }`
- Push shows preview only; in-app shows full when authenticated
- Respect user's privacy_settings from their profile

---

### Story 2B.6: Offline Sync Queue Foundation

As a **mobile user in a low-connectivity area**,
I want to **queue my actions when offline**,
So that **they sync when I'm back online**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user performs an action while offline
**When** the device has no network connection
**Then** the action is stored in local queue with timestamp
**And** the UI shows "Pending sync" indicator

**Given** the device regains connectivity
**When** the sync process runs
**Then** queued actions are sent to server in order
**And** successful syncs update local state
**And** the user sees "Synced" confirmation

**Given** a sync conflict occurs (server state changed)
**When** the conflict is detected
**Then** the user is prompted to resolve (keep local/server/merge)

**Technical Notes:**
- Client-side: AsyncStorage queue with retry logic
- Server-side: Idempotency keys to prevent duplicates
- Conflict resolution strategy documented per entity type

---

### Story 2B.7: Idempotency Pattern for API Operations

As a **backend developer**,
I want to **handle duplicate requests gracefully**,
So that **offline sync doesn't create duplicates**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a client sends a request with an idempotency key
**When** the same key is sent again
**Then** the server returns the cached response
**And** doesn't execute the operation twice

**Given** an idempotency key is older than 24 hours
**When** it's sent again
**Then** the key is treated as new (cache expired)

**Given** a request fails midway (network error)
**When** the client retries with the same idempotency key
**Then** the original operation is either completed or rolled back atomically

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `idempotency_keys` table: key, response, status, created_at
- Redis cache for fast lookups (TTL 24h)
- Idempotency header: `Idempotency-Key: uuid`

---

## Epic 3: Property & Building Management

**Goal:** Managers can create buildings and units with schema ready for Reality Portal. Residents associated with units.

### Story 3.1: Building Creation & Configuration

As a **property manager**,
I want to **create and configure buildings**,
So that **I can manage properties for my organization**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a manager navigates to "Add Building"
**When** they enter address, name, and building type
**Then** the building is created in the organization
**And** appears in the building list

**Given** a manager edits a building
**When** they update metadata (year built, floors, entrances)
**Then** the changes are saved
**And** reflected in the building detail view

**Given** a building has a valid address
**When** the address is saved
**Then** the system geocodes and stores coordinates
**And** the building can be displayed on a map

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `buildings` table: id, organization_id, name, address, coordinates, metadata (JSONB), created_at
- Include Reality Portal-ready fields: listing_status (nullable), public_description (nullable)
- Geocoding via external API (Google/Mapbox)

---

### Story 3.2: Unit Definition & Management

As a **property manager**,
I want to **define units within a building**,
So that **I can track individual apartments or spaces**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a manager is on a building detail page
**When** they add a unit with number, floor, and type (apartment, office, storage)
**Then** the unit is created and linked to the building

**Given** a manager configures a unit
**When** they set area (m²), room count, and ownership type (owner/rental)
**Then** the configuration is saved
**And** affects fee allocation calculations

**Given** multiple units exist in a building
**When** a manager views the unit list
**Then** units are sorted by floor and number
**And** show occupancy status (vacant, occupied, owner-occupied)

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `units` table: id, building_id, number, floor, type, area_m2, ownership_type, status
- Reality Portal fields: listing_metadata (JSONB, nullable), energy_certificate_id (FK, nullable)
- Schema supports future Phase 4 without migration

---

### Story 3.3: Resident Association with Units

As a **property manager**,
I want to **associate residents with units**,
So that **the right people receive relevant communications**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a manager adds a resident to a unit
**When** they specify the resident type (owner, tenant, family member)
**Then** the association is created
**And** the resident can access unit-specific content

**Given** a unit has multiple residents
**When** a manager views residents
**Then** they see all associated people with their roles
**And** can manage each individually

**Given** a resident moves out

**Then** the new version is saved with version number incremented
**And** previous versions remain accessible in version history
**And** the document list shows the latest version by default

**Given** a user views document version history
**When** they select a previous version
**Then** they can view or download that specific version
**And** see who uploaded it and when

**Given** a user restores a previous version
**When** they confirm the restoration
**Then** the old version becomes the new current version
**And** a new version entry is created (not destructive)

**Technical Notes:**
- Extend `documents`: add version_number (default 1), parent_document_id (nullable for version chains)
- Create `document_versions` view for history queries
- S3: each version is a separate object (no overwrite)

---

**Then** an e-signature request is created
**And** signers receive email invitations to sign

**Given** a signer completes their signature
**When** all signers have signed
**Then** the document is marked as fully signed
**And** a signed copy is stored in documents
**And** all parties receive confirmation

**Given** a signature request is pending
**When** the manager checks status
**Then** they see which signers have/haven't signed
**And** can send reminders to pending signers

**Technical Notes:**
- Integration: DocuSign or similar (API abstracted)
- Create `signature_requests` table: id, document_id, status, signers (JSONB), completed_at

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user opens notification preferences
**When** they view the event type list
**Then** they see all event categories (faults, votes, announcements, documents, etc.)
**And** can toggle each independently

**Given** a user disables "New Fault" notifications
**When** a new fault is created in their building
**Then** they don't receive push/email/in-app for that event
**And** other users with notifications enabled still receive them

**Given** a new event type is added to the system
**When** the user views preferences
**Then** the new type appears with sensible defaults (enabled)
**And** user can adjust as needed

**Technical Notes:**
- Extend `notification_preferences`: event_types (JSONB with per-type settings)
- Default schema: { "fault.created": true, "vote.started": true, ... }
- Migrate existing preferences (all true by default)

---

### Story 8B.2: Per-Channel Delivery Preferences

As a **user**,
I want to **control which channels each notification uses**,
So that **I can get urgent items via push but routine items only in-app**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user configures channel preferences for an event type
**When** they select channels (push, email, in-app)
**Then** notifications for that event use only selected channels
**And** unselected channels are skipped

**Given** a user sets "Vote Deadline" to push + email
**When** a vote deadline approaches
**Then** they receive both push notification and email
**And** the in-app notification is still created (always on)

**Given** a user sets "New Announcement" to in-app only
**When** an announcement is posted
**Then** they only see it in the notification center
**And** no push or email is sent

**Technical Notes:**
- Extend event_types JSONB: { "fault.created": { enabled: true, channels: ["push", "email", "in_app"] } }
- In-app always on (can be hidden but not disabled)
- UI: checkbox matrix (event types vs channels)

---

**Then** push notifications are held during those hours
**And** delivered when quiet hours end

**Given** a notification is high priority (e.g., emergency)
**When** it occurs during quiet hours
**Then** it is delivered immediately regardless of schedule
**And** is marked as priority override

**Given** a user is in a different timezone than their building
**When** quiet hours are evaluated
**Then** the user's configured timezone is used
**And** not the building or server timezone

**Technical Notes:**
- Add to `notification_preferences`: quiet_hours (JSONB: { enabled, start, end, timezone })
- Hold queue in Redis with scheduled delivery
- Priority flag on notification types (configurable by admin)

---

**When** a new manager joins the organization
**Then** their notification preferences are initialized with manager defaults
**And** they can customize from there

**Given** an admin updates role defaults
**When** they save changes
**Then** new users get updated defaults
**And** existing users retain their customized preferences

**Given** a user changes roles (promoted to manager)
**When** the role change is applied
**Then** they keep their existing preferences
**And** are notified of recommended settings for their new role

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `role_notification_defaults` table: id, organization_id, role, preferences (JSONB)
- On user creation: copy from role defaults
- On role change: optional "apply defaults" action

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user has the app open with WebSocket connected
**When** a new notification/fault/vote is created in their context
**Then** the update appears immediately (within 1 second)
**And** no manual refresh is needed

**Given** the WebSocket connection drops
**When** it reconnects
**Then** missed updates are fetched via REST delta sync
**And** the UI is updated accordingly

**Given** multiple browser tabs are open
**When** an update arrives
**Then** all tabs receive and display the update
**And** read states sync across tabs

**Technical Notes:**
- Axum WebSocket with per-user channels
- Redis pub/sub for cross-instance message routing
- Client: reconnect with exponential backoff
- Delta sync: last_sync_at timestamp comparison

---

### Story 2B-C.2: Mobile OS-Specific Push Integration

**When** they grant notification permissions
**Then** their FCM token is registered with the server
**And** push notifications work reliably

**Given** an iOS user installs the app
**When** they grant notification permissions
**Then** their APNs token is registered
**And** push notifications display correctly (even with app killed)

**Given** a user updates/reinstalls the app
**When** a new token is generated
**Then** the old token is invalidated
**And** the new token is registered seamlessly

**Technical Notes:**
- React Native: @react-native-firebase/messaging for both platforms
- Token refresh handling in app lifecycle

**Then** they see delivery rates by channel (push/email/in-app)
**And** open/click rates where trackable

**Given** push notifications fail to deliver
**When** the failure rate exceeds threshold (>5%)
**Then** an alert is triggered
**And** the operator can investigate (invalid tokens, service issues)

**Given** a specific notification type has low engagement
**When** compared to baseline
**Then** the operator can identify and adjust content/timing
**And** track improvement over time

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `notification_events` table: id, notification_id, event (sent, delivered, opened, clicked), timestamp
- Push: FCM/APNs delivery receipts
- Email: tracking pixels, link tracking
- Dashboard: aggregations by type, channel, time period
